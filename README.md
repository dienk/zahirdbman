# zahirdbman

A lightweight, self-contained **PostgreSQL database manager** with a web UI,
written in Go. Browse databases, schemas, tables and rows; run ad-hoc SQL; and
create or drop databases — all from the browser. The server compiles to a
single binary with the UI (templates + CSS) embedded.

## Features

- **Databases overview** — list every database with owner and on-disk size.
- **Table browser** — drill into a database to see its tables/views, estimated
  row counts and sizes; open a table to inspect columns and preview rows.
- **SQL console** — run arbitrary SQL against a selected database and view
  results in a table; non-SELECT statements report their command tag.
- **Create / drop databases** — with a confirmation guard and automatic
  termination of open sessions before a drop.
- **Backup & Restore** — download a `pg_dump` of any database (custom `.dump`
  or plain `.sql`), and restore an uploaded dump into a target database, with
  options to create the target first, clean existing objects, or ignore
  ownership. Requires the `pg_dump` / `pg_restore` / `psql` client tools on the
  server's `PATH` (bundled in the Docker image).
- **Self-contained** — templates and static assets are embedded via `go:embed`.
- **Safe by construction** — identifiers are validated and quoted; parameters
  use bound values.

## Requirements

- Go 1.23+
- A reachable PostgreSQL server

## Configuration

Configuration is read from environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable        | Default     | Description                                  |
|-----------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `ZDBM_ADDR`     | `:8080`     | HTTP listen address                          |
| `PGHOST`        | `localhost` | PostgreSQL host                              |
| `PGPORT`        | `5432`      | PostgreSQL port                              |
| `PGUSER`        | `postgres`  | Connection user                              |
| `PGPASSWORD`    | *(empty)*   | Connection password                          |
| `PGSSLMODE`     | `prefer`    | libpq SSL mode                               |
| `ZDBM_ADMIN_DB` | `postgres`  | Maintenance DB for server-wide operations    |

## Running

```sh
# using the Makefile
make run

# or directly
go run ./cmd/server
```

Then open <http://localhost:8080>.

To build a release binary:

```sh
make build      # produces bin/zahirdbman
./bin/zahirdbman
```

## Docker

The app builds to a static binary and ships in a minimal distroless image.

**Whole stack (app + PostgreSQL) with Compose:**

```sh
docker compose up --build      # or: make up
# open http://localhost:8080
docker compose down            # or: make down  (add -v to wipe the volume)
```

Compose starts PostgreSQL, waits until it is healthy (`pg_isready`), then
starts zahirdbman pointed at it (`PGHOST=db`, `PGSSLMODE=disable`). Override
`PGUSER` / `PGPASSWORD` / `ZDBM_ADMIN_DB` via a `.env` file or the shell.

**Just the app image, against an existing database:**

```sh
make docker-build                          # builds zahirdbman:latest
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 \
  -e PGHOST=host.docker.internal \
  -e PGUSER=postgres -e PGPASSWORD=secret \
  zahirdbman:latest
```

The image runs as a non-root user and exposes port `8080`.

## Project layout

## Health check

`GET /healthz` pings the admin database and returns `ok` (200) or an error (503).

## Security notes

zahirdbman executes SQL you type and can drop databases. Run it only against
servers you control, ideally behind authentication / a private network. It does
not add its own auth layer.
